Reader Robert let me know that both Animoogs were updated today with new sound expansion pack from Richard Devine for Devine is one of my favorite sound designers so this is real treat for me The new timbres and presets are brutal but crisp so they should be fairly easy to work with instead of the sloppy mess that was Speaking of which has been removed from the Store Robert points out that this means everyone who purchased it is essentially out if they ever need to restore guess that bit academic because there is no restore purchases option at all in the app Definitely not cool Moog Sure it was only buck and some gimmicky shit sounds but it was our gimmicky shit sounds after we paid you the buck Retina support is still missing which is odd after we ve had two updates since the release of the iPad Update Moog tweeted that anyone needing to restore or any sound pack can contact techsupport moogmusic com and they will be able to help sincerely hope that we will see some better support from Moog in the very near future but as it stands this new pack sounds like it is worth the You can hear some of the new sounds over on Moog site Embeded below is great

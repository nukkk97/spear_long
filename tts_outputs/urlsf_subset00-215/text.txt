Humans will either go extinct or be forced to return to hunter gatherer lifestyles if we continue to destroy Earth plant life study has found John Schramski from the University of Georgia has said our planet will become less and less hospitable as result of plant loss and if we do not go extinct our lifestyles will revert to those of our ancestors years ago In study published in the journal PNAS Schramski and colleagues used thermodynamics to look at the chemical energy stored in plants and the rate at which it is being destroyed to establish the consequences of continued destruction Earth was an empty landscape for billions of years until organisms evolved to transform sunlight into energy After this there was an explosion of plant and animal life The researchers estimate the planet contained around billion tonnes of carbon in plant life years ago and that since then humans have reduced that amount by around half destroying it to make room for cities and agriculture It is thought we have destroyed around of this bank of carbon in the last years You can think of the Earth like battery that has been charged very slowly over billions of years Schramski said The sun energy is

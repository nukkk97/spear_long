Here ll point out another of the articles going up at the Life Extension Advocacy Foundation this time on the topic of the naturalistic fallacy where it occurs in opposition to healthy life extension Our community would like to build medical therapies that address the causes of aging thereby ending age related disease and greatly extending healthy human life spans It has always surprised me to find that most people at least initially object to this goal It seems perfectly and straightforwardly obvious to me that aging to death suffering considerably along the way is just as much problem to be overcome as any other medical condition that causes pain and mortality Yet opposition exists and that opposition is one of the greatest challenges faced when raising funding and pushing forward with research and development of rejuvenation therapies When it comes to treating aging as medical condition the naturalistic fallacy is voiced in this way aging is natural what is natural is good and therefore we shouldn tamper with aging If you look around at your houses your computers your modern medicine and consider that such an objection is perhaps just little late to the game and hard to hold in self consistent manner

The time has come for us to officially announce the Immutant project Immutant is going to be for Clojure what TorqueBox is for Ruby true enterprise grade application server encapsulating the robust services provided by JBoss within intuitive Clojure API Further Immutant has inspired us to attempt to achieve sort of polyglot cafeteria plan of app serving For example your application might consist of Ruby web app in the front and Clojure data mining services in the rear loosely but securely coupled via JSON encoded asynchronous messages You choose the JVM based languages and frameworks that make the most sense for each of your application components And Immutant will provide uniform deployment platform and the glue those critical enterprisey services like messaging security transactions clustering etc that all successful applications eventually require Why Because learning new programming languages is fun Because no one language is good for everything non trivial application needs to do Because JBoss wants to be everywhere But mostly because we want to App servers get bad rap and bad app servers deserve it but simple deployment clustering and messaging are all good things Embracing

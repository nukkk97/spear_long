On yesterdays episode of Savage Lovecast straight listener called in with question for host Dan Savage about etiquette for straight people attending Pride Dont eat the pussy at Pride its not for you Savage dryly offered unless its bi pussy in which case go crazy Then in his Savage ian way Dan inexplicably went from sharp tongued one liner to gay preacher man Pride is in many ways manifestation of queer people in the streets making themselves visible not to each other but to straight people straight culture and straight world that for most of recorded history wanted to pretend that we did not exist He went on to tell the caller that being straight person attending Pride is not an intrusion not violation but rather partly the point of Pride When we are in the streets and we are the majority we dont start straight bashing people we dont get all our revenge on the gay bashers You are not going to be bashed You may even get laid because bisexual ladies are big part of pride The only thing you really dont have to do is walk up to everyone you meet and announce loudly that youre straight If you are straight and you are at Pride someone may assume that you are gay

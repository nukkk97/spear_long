The book presents the results of combined examinations of stable isotope transmutation processes in growing microbiological cultures In this book the processes of transmutation of different stable isotopes in growing biological systems are examined from three different points of view as the totality of experimental facts of low temperature isotopes transmutation as nuclear science based process and as process studied from of biochemistry of live systems For the first time the experimental observation and study of low energy nuclear transmutation of light intermediate and heavy mass isotopes were carried out in growing microbiological cultures Bacillus subtilis Escherichia coli and yeast culture Saccharomyces cerevisiae with controlled conditions of growth The rate of these isotopes transmutation equals The physical mechanism of non barrier nuclear interaction in optimal non stationary microcavities in growing biological objects is discussed The biological reasons of nuclear fusion in growing systems are also investigated in details lot of possible applications of the phenomenon of isotope transmutation are discussed txt ustar German Patients to Receive Medical Marijuana Pressure from the Bush Administration t

Physical properties of container media Introduction Container media is made by mixing several components The physical properties of the mixed media are different from individual components functions of media Root anchorage Nutrient retention Gas exchange Water supply Defining container physical properties Bark particle size influences media physical properties As particle size increases from left to right so does total porosity Air vs water The volume of water held at each level of the container is listed Water is not distributed evenly the contaienr bottom is saturated while the top is drier Water is not distributed evenly throughout the container Adhesion cohesion and capillary action attract water to particles and resist gravity The ability of media to hold water through adhesion and cohesion is referred to as matric potential Matric potential is the same throughout the container Gravity pulls water down through the container and out of the drainage holes While gravity is constant throughout the container gravitational potential is greater at the top of the container and lower at the bottom Because of this g

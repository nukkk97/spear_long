The New York Jets kick off their four game preseason this Saturday night at home against the Tennessee Titans What matters this preseason Lets break it down OFF ALL GEAR USING THE CODE Its The Quarterback Stupid The most important thing this preseason is the performance of Christian Hackenberg the only quarterback on this roster with theoretical chance of being the guy long term Josh McCown is glorified Game of Thrones Maester Bryce Petty is career third stringer who has already been knocked out of the quarterback competition in practice The discouraging thing to date is at best Hackenberg has played even to McCown below average journeyman The encouraging thing is that practice doesnt matter all that much and if Hackenberg plays well in the preseason nobody cares about what happens in camp It still remains more than likely McCown will start week but Hackenberg can put pressure on those plans and shorten his already tiny rope with strong preseason What is strong preseason Complete somewhere around of your passes Throw more touchdowns than interceptions Do not take unnecessary sacks and protect the football when you are sacked Attack down the field and show signs

Sometimes you want to try something new Like last week when wanted to implement builder for domain object In Java lest you wonder why the code samples in this post are so long Sometimes you want to try something new Like last week when wanted to implement builder for domain object In Java lest you wonder why the code samples in this post are so long The rationale for wanting builders for domain objects goes roughly like this You want domain objects that are never in an inconsistent state immutable domain objects preferably to avoid telescoping constructors taking all combinations of optional fields on your object upfront nice API for building your domain objects Granted you could just use Scala case classes with named parameters and call it day Alas this was no such day On the shoulders of giants Obviously the builder pattern has been belaboured by many who are greater than am In fact the original Gang of Four description dates back to But here we are in Let say we want domain object modeling pizza orders The usual solution looks somewhat like this using static inner class to implement the build

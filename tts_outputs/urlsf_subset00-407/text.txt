Today while regarding gross bodily fluid airplane story commenter told us commuting tale of such extreme horror that we re inclined to believe it not true Weigh in for yourself If it real holy shit From Jstas was on the Market Frankford line in Philly when was in college had to be at school extra early because some genius decided that AM was an appropriate time to take final exam in Bio Chemistry It was really frickin cold out and as sitting on the train this homeless woman gets on She naked from the waist down but covered by this poncho thing She standing there shivering even though the train is sweltering and smells like moldy gym socks She was holding on to an upright with both hands and legs spread like she was going to drop an epic deuce right there Little did know Then she gets real wide eyed and starts growling or grrr ing but like she whispering She shakes bit and then this ocean of effluence rockets out her lady parts and this deformed fetus hits the deck There she is with this dead baby on the umbilical cord stretched out from her lady parts and she start looking around at everyone staring at her Then she starts shouting WHAT THE IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE

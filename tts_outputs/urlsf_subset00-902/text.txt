Using genetic algorithms to find Starcraft build orders Posted by Louis Brandy on November UPDATE Just to make this explicitly clear did not write this program The fourth sentence makes this fairly clear but some comments indicate that some people are bit lazy also added video of the rush to the bottom ve been on bit of starcraft kick recently also work in computer vision and general AI has always been an interest Sometimes strange interests collide Over on forum called teamliquid user by the name of Lomilar posted fairly long thread about program he had written that optimized build orders for the zerg race in starcraft He eventually cleaned up his code and posted the code to googlecode The program is called EvolutionChamber and it uses genetic algorithms to find build orders This had to see quick Starcraft primer setting up the rules Since this is primarily programming blog going to assume you know fair bit about video games Feel free to skip this section if you know anything about starcraft in particular Essentially is real time strategy game that starts you with simple base some workers and some resources and asks you to put those work

High Temperatures Persistent Heat Molten Steel at WTC Site Contradict Official Story Architects Engineers for Truth Extremely high temperatures were evident before and during the destruction of the World Trade Center Twin Towers and at Ground Zero Seven minutes before the destruction of the South Tower flow of molten metal appeared accompanied by several smaller flows as documented by the National Institute of Standards and Technology The materials glowing color showed that its temperature was close to white hot at the very beginning of the flow and yellow orange further down Iron rich spheres in the WTC dust are additional proof of temperatures above the melting point of iron Pyroclastic like rapidly expanding dust clouds after the destruction of the Towers can also be explained only by the expansion of hot gases An excavating machine at Ground Zero lifts debris dripping with molten metal The high temperature phenomena at Ground Zero are documented by various sources Bechtel engineers responsible for safety at Ground Zero wrote in theJournal of the American Society of Safety Engineers The debris pile at Ground Zero was always tremendously hot Thermal measurements taken by helicopter each day showed underground temperatures r

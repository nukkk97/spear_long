The GRACE mission was selected as the second mission under the NASA Earth System Science Pathfinder Program in May Launched in March of the GRACE mission is accurately mapping variations in Earth gravity field Designed for nominal mission lifetime of five years GRACE is currently operating in an extended mission phase which is expected to continue through at least GRACE consists of two identical spacecraft that fly about kilometers apart in polar orbit kilometers above Earth GRACE maps Earth gravity field by making accurate measurements of the distance between the two satellites using GPS and microwave ranging system It is providing scientists from all over the world with an efficient and cost effective way to map Earth gravity field with unprecedented accuracy The results from this mission are yielding crucial information about the distribution and flow of mass within Earth and its surroundings The gravity variations studied by GRACE include changes due to surface and deep currents in the ocean runoff and ground water storage on land masses exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the ocean and variations of mass within Eart

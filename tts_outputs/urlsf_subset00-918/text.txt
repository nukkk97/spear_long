If you know about Either Maybe and JS generators already just take look at the code Javascript is likely to introduce generators into the language number of cool things are enabled by generators ability to control the flow of function from outside ve used them here to build useful boiler plate reduction tool similar to the idea of Haskell Either and Maybe It not intended as something to use just as an experiment What Either Maybe or If you don know about Maybe and Either ll give brief intro If you do let talk about JS There are better guides but ll have go Either and Maybe replace code that checks for invalid values in process Maybe handles missing things no matching record in the database no such key in Map Either handles things that could go wrong no such file numerical calculations out of domain etc The core idea is to split what you want to do with something apart from checking and handling whether it missing or invalid Rather than having lots of error checking after each potentially missing erroneous step you simply write your code as if everything is perfect and Either and Maybe machinery will handle any problems Here an example var user

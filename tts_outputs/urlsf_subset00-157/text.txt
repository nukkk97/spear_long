November More Quasi Single Ended Amplifier have lots more to say on the topic of single ended amplifiers but only have so much time today so here is quick post have enjoyed an email exchange with TCJer Sheldon who is designing interesting hybrid power amplifier topologies He pointed out that the new hot thing is to load chip power amplifier output such as the with constant current source which will cause displacement of the amplifier crossover points within the output stage transistors Cambridge Audio calls the technique Class XD which covered in post number in In in the Tube CAD Journal you will find the following schematic This idea is old hat to those working with OpAmps so wasn claiming any new topology let alone creating new class of operation rather was pointing out that such setup could be implemented externally to an existing power amplifier in other words as an add on enhancement in its own enclosure Of course the huge problem is heat as the existing power amplifier output stage will now greatly increase its dissipation With chip amplifiers this problem is particularly acute as they are relativ

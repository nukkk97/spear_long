Version alpha attacks mainly the initial sync problems saw lot of users had crashes there Some of the errors saw where reported upstream to the go team Some now even have milestones attached Unfortunately it happened really often in the initial sync with the chain on some devices These problems are not solved yet but could gather some more information about them and found way to mitigate the problem bit The crashes only happen when you have to import lot of headers like with the initial sync You will not see it that often once you had full sync and update regularly For the initial sync added watchdog that restarts the app once this happens did not find way to get geth in working state again once these crashes happened Also added debug screen where you can see the error log This should help to reduce the frustration for the initial sync Just open walleth enable the light client put your phone in WIFI and attach the charger Then wait while Your phone might get warm If you see these crashes please use the share button in the debug activity to share the reports Or even better look at the reports and try to check if it is one of these issues If so please these issue

Antarctic ice core sheds new light on how the last ice age ended by Staff Writers Washington DC Aug Analysis of an ice core taken by the National Science Foundation funded West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide drilling project reveals that warming in Antarctica began about years ago few thousand years earlier than suggested by previous records This timing shows that West Antarctica did not wait for cue from the Northern Hemisphere to start warming as scientists had previously supposed For more than century scientists have known that Earth ice ages are caused by the wobbling of the planet orbit which changes its orientation to the sun and affects the amount of sunlight reaching higher latitudes The Northern Hemisphere last ice age ended about years ago and most evidence had indicated that the ice age in the Southern Hemisphere ended about years later suggesting that the South was responding to warming in the North But research published online Aug in the journal Nature shows that Antarctic warming began at least two and perhaps four millennia earlier than previously thought Most previous evidence for Antarctic climate change had come from ice cores drilled in East Antarctica the highest and c

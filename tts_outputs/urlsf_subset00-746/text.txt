Mathematical epidemiologists create far more complex models than the simulations above to answer three key questions about outbreaks How contagious is it How quickly will it spread And how many people will it kill These models help public health officials develop strategies to attack specific outbreaks Read related article Compared to other infectious diseases Ebola spreads slowly and to relatively few people But it is extremely deadly The World Health Organization said percent of cases in this year outbreak are fatal Ebola SARS and chicken pox take roughly the same amount of time to pass from one sick person to the next group of people called generation If Ebola were as easy to catch as chicken pox thousands of people would have been sickened by the fourth generation By the numbers Disease Avg Reproductive ratio Avg Serial interval Avg fatality rate Ebola Smallpox Measles SARS Diphtheria Whooping cough Flu Rubella Mumps Chicken pox Why do these squares look different every time Disease estimations rarely have precise neat numbers One outbreak may spread more quickly or kill higher percentage of people than another So our models run different scenarios based on ranges provided to us b

In Transformational Discipleship we unpacked the important relationship between truth posture and leaders God brings about transformation as godly leaders apply the truth to our hearts while we are in teachable posture Truth The Lord transforms us sanctifies us through His truthand His Word is truth The truth of the gospel and the truth of Gods Word has the power to change us and mold us into the image of His Son Posture God puts us in teachable and moldable posture to receive His truth For example He will use trials spiritual disciplines and biblical community to soften our hearts toward His truth If you are preacher or teacher you have surely observed the importance of teachable posture as you have preached or taught the same message to group of people and some have been impacted while some have been hardened The message and the messenger are the same but the posture of each person is different Leaders God uses leaders to apply grace to our hearts Each person in the body is given the opportunity to administer grace in variety of forms Because of this truth pastors and teachers are wise to equip all of Gods people for ministry so that more people can encounter His grace

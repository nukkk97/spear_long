May Continuing with objections to raising the maximum block size More transactions means more bandwidth and CPU and storage cost and more cost means increased centralization because fewer people will be able to afford that cost cant argue with the first part of that statement more transactions will mean more validation cost But how much Is it significant enough to worry about Ill use ChunkHosts current pricing to do some back of the envelope calculations Im not affiliated with ChunkHost Im using them for this example because they accept Bitcoin and Ive been happy customer of theirs for while now CPU and storage are cheap these days one moderately fast CPU can easily keep up with megabytes worth of transactions every ten minutes Twenty megabytes downloaded plus twenty megabytes uploaded every ten minutes is about gigabytes bandwidth usage per month well within the terabytes month limit of even the least expensive ChunkHost plan Disk space shouldnt be an issue very soon now that blockchain pruning has been implemented you dont have to dedicate gigabytes to store the entire blockchain So it looks to me like the actual out of pocket cost

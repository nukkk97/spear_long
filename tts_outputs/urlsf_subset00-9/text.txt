At source we believe theres possibility for programs to write code and for new forms of automatic programming to emerge Our Roadmap states the first step in this direction as Build representations of source code developers and projects Today we are announcing Babelfish the project we are developing to build these representations of source code Whats Babelfish Babelfish is universal code parser It aims to parse any file in any language extract an abstract syntax tree from it and convert it to Universal Abstract Syntax Tree Well thats our objective we are not there just yet but we have designed an architecture to achieve exactly that and were currently working on it The architecture of Babelfish As shown in the figure Babelfish is client server system Clients are source code analysis tools that rely on the server for actual source code parsing written in different programming languages Architecture overview The server itself uses language drivers to perform the parsing which are divided in two parts in order to minimise the work of developing new driver language code parser which builds native AST This parser can be built directly from the target languages compiler tools or li

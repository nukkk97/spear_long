Its not often that one film attempts so many different things and manages to make none of them work but gosh darn it Suburbicon somehow makes such blundering seem easy Director George Clooney packs whole lot of ideas into his tale of the underbelly of suburbia but theyre really bad lazy ideas which is shame because Suburbicon has quite the pedigree The biggest problem with Suburbicon is that its really two different movies cobbled together One movie is dark farcical Coen Brothers style crime movie Which makes sense since the Coens have writing credit on the film But then theres the other movie one that deals with racism and white supremacy This is an element of the film that absolutely none of the advertising even hints at which is kind of strange You really shouldnt hold movies advertising against it but the trailers for Suburbicon make it look like wacky dark comedy about family man in the fighting back against his tormentors Thats not even close to what this movie is about and the fact that the trailers tried to sell it as that hints at movie that folks dont know how to sell Suburbicon is the perfect community with nice friendly faces

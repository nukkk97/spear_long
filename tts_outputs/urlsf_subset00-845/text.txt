Winning at all costs trumps moral integrity The presidency of Donald Trump has divided the citizens of this country right down to the closest of kin Not since the Civil War have mothers fathers sisters brothers wives and husbands seen their once inviolable bonds of family unity stretched to their limits often experiencing complete irreversible break How could this have happened again believe it all comes down to where one stands in regard to the question Do the ends justify the means Even if the kinder more sensitive Trump were able to accomplish any of the myriad promises he spits out like pumpkin seed shells the means he used to achieve his place at the dais was shameful Keep in mind that the various means used by Trump to become president will now serve as the justification for future generations behaving in like manner If you admonish your child for mocking the handicapped he simply can say that Trump did it and he became president If your child gives cruel and derisive names to his fellow schoolmates he can say it didnt stop Trump from succeeding When your son brags about his ability as sexual predator you can beam with pride that hes following in the footstep

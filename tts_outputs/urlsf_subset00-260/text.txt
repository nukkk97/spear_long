The iron catastrophe was postulated major geological event early in the history of Earth The original accretion of the Earth material into spherical mass is thought to have resulted in relatively uniform composition While residual heat from the collision of the material that formed the Earth was significant heating from radioactive materials in this mass gradually increased the temperature until critical condition was reached As material became molten enough to allow movement the denser iron and nickel evenly distributed throughout the mass began to migrate to the center of the planet to form the core The gravitational potential energy released by the sinking of the dense NiFe globules along with any cooler denser solid material is thought to have been runaway process increasing the temperature of the protoplanet above the melting point of most components resulting in the rapid formation of molten iron core covered by deep global silicate magma This event an important process of planetary differentiation occurred at about million years into the formation of the planet Formation of Earth magnetosphere This large spinning mass of super hot metal is responsible for the creation of the Earth magnetic field the magnetosphere whi

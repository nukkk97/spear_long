As you read this the neurons in your brain are creating spectacular supernova of electrical impulses connecting to each other in scandalously convoluted and ever changing patterns How this neural chaos translates into thoughts insights feelings and awareness is something that even the greatest minds have failed to fathom yet researchers from the University of Warwick may have now finally discovered the fundamental property underlying intelligence Reporting their findings in the journal Brain the authors reveal how their research not only sheds light on the cerebral processes behind humans exceptional learning abilities but could also help to explain the many mysteries behind mental illness In their write up the team note that until now the majority of studies into the roots of consciousness have tended to look at either the overall activity of the brain when performing certain tasks or specific individual connections between two chosen brain regions However no one has yet investigated what the researchers call the temporal variability of the functional architecture of the brain In more basic terms this refers to the amount by which the patterns of communication between particular brain region and all other regions changes over time thereby giving an in

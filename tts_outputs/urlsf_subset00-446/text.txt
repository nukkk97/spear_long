by Vijay Prozak on May Any really efficient design will gradually replace its less efficient parts with new attempts This type of natural garbage collection is at an informational level present in our universe meaning that it appears as pattern in matter energy and thought alike This type of chaotic design appears frequently Instead of using top down centralized orders chaotic designs change like fluids in beaker with granular components adopting the shape of the boundaries of their container and by staying always in motion sweeping smaller eddies into the bigger trends of their flow Information tends to follow similar pattern based on the Gaussian distribution which we generally see as bell curve when plotted in two dimensions few clear success few clear failures and everything else in the middle This is similar to how fluid in beaker moves at its edges will all motions flowing back into main mass which is mostly stable Chaotic designs are famous for this kind of stable in the big picture frenetically disordered at local level appearance Its an inherent principle of our universe to behave this way because it gets the benefits of stability with the chan

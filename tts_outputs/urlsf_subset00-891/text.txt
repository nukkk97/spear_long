British Scientists Seek Permission To Edit DNA In Human Embryos British scientists announced Friday that they had applied for permission to edit the DNA in human embryos controversial step that has provoked intense debate around the world Kathy Niakan of The Francis Crick Institute in London and colleagues filed an application with the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority which regulates experiments involving human embryos in England To provide further fundamental insights into early human development we are proposing to test the function of genes using gene editing and transfection approaches Niakan said in written statement released by the institute The researchers stressed that their work would be aimed only at gaining basic understanding of the genes human embryos need to develop and none of the embryos would be used to try to create baby The research would use embryos left over at fertility clinics Scientists around the world are debating the ethics of using new technology known as CRISPR to make genetic changes in human eggs sperm or embryos CRISPR enables scientists to make very precise changes in DNA much more easily than before Some oppose any use of the technology on human eggs sperm or embryos

Pulsa deNura Pulsa diNura or Pulsa Denoura is purportedly Kabbalistic ceremony in which the destroying angels are invoked to block heavenly forgiveness of the subject sins causing all the curses named in the Bible to befall him resulting in his death However the Torah prohibits praying that something bad should happen to another person Rather it offers the solution to pray that the bad in the person die and he become righteous person The source for this modern ritual is not to be found in Kabbalah but among the Hebrew magical manuals of antiquity such as Sefer HaRazim and The Sword of Moses Overview The origin of this phrase seems to come from the Babylonian Talmud in tractate Hagigah This page contains an Aggadic section concerning the heresies of Elisha ben Abuyah An account is given of Elisha encounter with the angel Metatron and the subsequent erroneous course of action taken by Metatron The seeming mistake of Metatron established him as being liable to receive sentence of sixty pulse deNura They took out Metatron and lashed him with sixty pulses of fire pulsa denura is also mentioned once in the Zohar one of the classic works of Kabbalah

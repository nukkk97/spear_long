Why Upset at NorthumbriaPCC My Story In total spent years with my ex partner It wasn until years into the relationship after we had taken break from each other that the emotional attacks began Constant belittling and mockery in private that then spilled out into public few of my friends remarked on her treatment of me but didn put two and two together The constant put downs continued was working to try and restart my professional career which she would constantly refer to as waste of time or just playing on your computer when talking about me working on projects for clients She then began to isolate me from my family and friends She would fake breakdowns when we visited them causing me to usher us both away with excuses and embarrassment Her temper was also very big issue would feel like had to tiptoe around her in fear of an explosive row where once again would be mocked derided and called names and the kicker was she was able to convince me deserved it If ever tried to stand up for myself her temper would flair up and she would hurl cups glasses etc around the kitchen at home Choosing items that my son had bought

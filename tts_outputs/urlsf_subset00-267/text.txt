Much like Bandai Namco Games earlier today Capcom held their very own panel at San Diego Comic Con this evening While the formers obviously focused on Tekken the latters was all about Street Fighter more specifically Ultra Street Fighter IV Unfortunately there wasnt much worth note discussed at Capcoms panel but they did reveal some interesting extras that the community may be interested in First off they are working on brand new batch of downloadable content that will add Summer Vacation outfits to the game According to Electronic Gaming Monthly staffer Shidoshi these include scuba diving gear for Rufus summer dress for Elena Chinese dress for Poison golfwear for Dan bathing suit for Decapre prep school uniform for Dudley Hawaiian Blanka and more It has yet to be disclosed by anyone in attendance if this new group of alternate costumes will extend to the whole or only select few like past offerings The normally talkative Yoshinori Ono was apparently tight lipped this time around telling fans that he will not be making any fighting game announcements this year and asking for another layer of patience from the community

computer code used by physicists around the world to analyze and predict tokamak experiments can now approximate the behavior of highly energetic atomic nuclei or ions in fusion plasmas more accurately than ever The new capability developed by physicist Mario Podest at the Department of Energy Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory outfits the code known as TRANSP with subprogram that simulates the motion that leads to the loss of energetic ions caused by instabilities in the plasma that fuels fusion reactions The code whose name is derived from the term transport is housed at PPPL Podest modeled the highly energetic ions that are used to heat the plasma These particles which physicists inject as neutral atoms are ionized inside the plasma and increase its thermal energy The model could also apply to fusion generated energetic particles in future tokamaks Physicists need to predict and minimize the loss of these ions from the plasma in doughnut shaped facilities called tokamaks to achieve high level of performance Sudden loss can halt fusion reactions and damage plasma facing components Predicting and controlling heat loss will be crucial for ITER the international tokamak under construction in F

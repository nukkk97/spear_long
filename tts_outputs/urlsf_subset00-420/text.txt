Infants process faces long before they recognize other objects Stanford vision researchers find Using brain monitoring technology Stanford psychology researchers have discovered that infant brains respond to faces in much the same way as adult brains do even while the rest of their visual system lags behind Any mother will tell you that infants love staring at faces It isn just parental wishful thinking either studies show that babies even those less than an hour old tend to stare at face like images longer than at any other pattern But this preference is little surprising newborns visual systems aren yet fully developed and infants often have trouble distinguishing between basic shapes How can they zero in on something as complex as face Courtesy of Stanford Vision and NeuroDevelopment Lab Using net of electroencephalographic sensors the researchers noninvasively measured the electrical activity of participants brains New research from psychology Research Professor Anthony Norcia and postdoctoral fellow Faraz Farzin both of the Stanford Vision and NeuroDevelopment Lab suggests physical basis for infants ogling At as early as four months babies brains already process faces at nearly adult levels even while other images are still b
